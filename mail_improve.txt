Phase 1 – Assess & Scope
- Capture current MailController flow, view models, and Razor partial usage.
- Note data needs for inbox/outbox/drafts lists, compose form, and message detail preview.
- Confirm global layout knobs (ViewBag.HideSidebars) required to give Mail page full width.

Phase 2 – Data & Controller Enhancements
- Extend MailIndexViewModel to include a SelectedMessage payload for the inline viewer.
- Update MailController.Index to accept an optional messageId, fetch the requested/first message for the active tab, and mark messages read when appropriate.
- Ensure ViewBag.HideSidebars is set for Index/View responses.

Phase 3 – Razor Layout Overhaul
- Replace tabbed Bootstrap table UI in Views/Mail/Index.cshtml with the three-column grid (categories, message list, message viewer/compose).
- Integrate categories sidebar, search bar (non-functional placeholder), unread indicators, and New Message button; wire category links to existing tab querystring.
- Build responsive/mobile variants (stacked columns, overlay toggles disabled without JS).

Phase 4 – List, Viewer, & Compose Integration
- Render inbox/outbox/drafts data inside the messages list column with per-message metadata, unread styling, and active-state binding tied to the SelectedMessage id.
- Show SelectedMessage in the viewer column (subject, metadata, body, Reply/Forward/Delete buttons hooking to existing actions/routes); display empty state when nothing selected.
- When ActiveTab == "new", swap the viewer column contents for the compose form, ensuring existing send/save draft endpoints and validation messages surface inline.

Phase 5 – Polish, Verify, & Deploy
- Add view-scoped CSS (no JS) for dark theme grid, buttons, scrollbars, and responsive adjustments.
- Manually test each tab, draft sending, and SelectedMessage navigation across Desktop + narrow viewport.
- Execute ./redeploy.sh and confirm health checks; capture any residual warnings for follow-up.
